Carpentry
The trees from the green forests on our island may be strong enough even for our phalanxes' shields.  And a strong woodwork can carry the roofs of our buildings.  But in order to be so, the lumbers must be chosen and handled properly!  A Carpenter in our town would take care of it and we would use much fewer building material!
8
Allows: Construction of Carpenter's.

Deck Weapons
A rotating attachment for our battleships on which we can mount huge weapons!  For a start our inventors have mounted a huge crossbow on it.  But we assume that the attachment will be able to bear other machines, too.  So as soon as one of our scientists has an idea we can install it on our ships without any problem.

Allows: Building of Ballista Ship's in the Shipyard's.
Requirement(s):	Carpentry ( Seafaring )
Dry-Dock ( Military )
Ship Maintenance
If we always keep our ships nice and clean, they don't have to be repaired that often.  It will also keep up the morale of the crew when they sing some songs together from time to time while scrubbing the deck or mending the sail cloths.
24
Allows: Reduction in upkeep costs for ships by - 2%.

Draft
Our scientists have found out that our ships have less water resistance when their load is smaller.  This means that we can put larger sails on the mast and travel more quickly.

Wealth
The earth is full of valuable treasures!  We have learned how to mine sulphur and crystal glass and how to chisel marble off rocks.  We are also growing wonderful vines on the fertile land on our hills which produce delicious wine!  A new era of prosperity will dawn on us when we start using these treasures.  We can then sell goods at a Trading post and buy what we need from foreign traders.

Improved Resource Gathering
Some time has passed since we learned how to use the treasures of our island for our needs.  We should now educate our workers and let every forest, quarry or vineyard, every sulphur pit or crystal mine administer by men who are not only strong but also skillful.  This way we will gather even more income and our civilization will get richer than ever!

Architecture
A good house can withstand the harshest elements.  It can withstand them even better when a bright mind takes care of it with many drawings and a little mathematics before hand, so that all walls are straight and the roof is tight.  Thanks to angle and compass our buildings will be much more stable and well protected from the rain.  An Architect's Office would spare us much marble, just think about the savings constructing a new building!

Our culture is truly rich in delicious treats!  If we have cooks joining our soldiers in battle it won't take more than the smell, that reminds them of their home kitchens, to strengthen their fighting spirit.  And it shouldn't be forgotten, that a hearty meal has always brought a man back onto his feet.  And of course a cook has a sharp knife he can jump in to the fight with.
